<b>Data Analytics Portfolio Repository</b>

<p> Hello, <br/>
this repository is meant to showcase some of the Data Analytics personal projects that I have undertaken in the last few years.<br/> 
<p>While it is still a work in progress, ultimately my goals is to add several examples of Tableau and Python work in the areas of data exploration and cleaning, predictive analytics, data visualization, as well as cool, engaging story telling from the insights gathered in the process of analysing these public datasets.
<p>I hope you enjoy the content!<br/>
<p>Thank you for visiting,<br/>
