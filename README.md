<b>Data Analytics Portfolio Repository</b>

<p> Hello, <br/>
this repository is meant to showcase some of the Data Analytics personal projects that I have undertaken in the last few years.<br/> 
<p>It is still a work in progress. Ultimately my goals is to add several examples of Tableau and Python work in the areas of data exploration and cleaning, predictive analytics, data visualization, as well as cool, engaging story telling from the insights gathered in the process of analysing some public datasets.
  
<p>Current Repository Contents (2/10/22):
  <ul>Analysis of Chicago's crime rate trends and implications for Real Estate development (data preparation done in Knime and visualizatios in Tableau). I suggest you look at the powerpoint presentation first, then delve into the code if interested in the details.</ul>
   <ul> World Energy Sources Analysis from 2000 thru 2016: data preparation in Python. Coming soon, I'll add the data visualizations and dashboard in Tableau.</ul>
 
<p>I hope you enjoy the content! <br/>
<p>Thank you for visiting,<br/>
